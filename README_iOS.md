<strong>⚠️ Why AnkiMobile is a Paid App</strong>

The **AnkiMobile** app for iOS (iPhone/iPad) costs **$29.99** (price subject to change). This fee supports:

*   Continuous development and maintenance of the Anki ecosystem across **all platforms**.
*   App store costs (such as Apple Developer fees).
*   Compensation for the lead developer, Damien Elmes, who provides the desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) and web (AnkiWeb) versions **for free**.

This business model ensures the sustainability of a high-quality, open-source project.  
**Purchasing the app remains the best way to support the project and get an optimal, offline review experience on iOS.**
