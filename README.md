## 🎯 About This Deck

This tactical deck has been designed as a **versatile and scientifically optimized training tool** that adapts to several chess learning approaches. Unlike traditional puzzle platforms that focus on immediate gratification, this deck emphasizes **deep learning through visualization** and **pattern recognition mastery**.

***

## 🧠 Training Philosophy: Why Visualization Matters

The only way to use puzzles and transpose them into real games is to learn to calculate, visualize the move tree, and quickly recognize attack and defense patterns. Doing puzzles on platforms, whatever they are, brings very little except immediate dopamine. It's pleasant to move pieces and see a green light indicating you found the expected solution, but **you don't absorb the positions, you don't really learn to visualize**.

**What I offer here is radical**, in the sense that it attacks the root of the problems: **visualization**. No coordinates, no piece movement, no indication arrows—only the board and your brain. Here you will need to think, learn to read coordinates, anticipate, all in a modern and clean interface. It will be difficult at first, both because of the coordinates and the moves to visualize, but you will quickly see improvements by doing ~20 new puzzles per day. And by doing I mean really try to visualize and find moves (e.g. "OK, in this position, I think next best moves are Nf7 Rh7+ Kxh7").

***

## 🔬 Training Methodologies

### **1. Woodpecker Method by ELO Range 🔨**
Each range (~1200 puzzles, 14 sub-decks: <1000, 1000–1100, …, 1700–1800, 1800–1900, 1900–2000, 2000–2200, 2200+) allows you to apply the famous Woodpecker method: solve the same set multiple times in accelerated cycles to develop automatic recognition of tactical patterns. This approach transforms conscious thinking into unconscious reflexes, drastically increasing calculation speed in games. [[1](https://forwardchess.com/blog/what-is-the-woodpecker-method/)]

### **2. Personalized Spaced Repetition 🧠🔄**
Use Anki's spaced repetition system to optimize learning according to your current level. The carefully selected puzzles guarantee constant progress without excessive frustration. Research shows that spaced repetition improves long-term retention by **200-300%** compared to traditional methods. [[2](https://www.bananote.ai/blog/the-complete-spaced-repetition-schedule-for-long-term-retention-a-science-based-guide-to-never-forgetting-what-you-learn)], [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12357012/)]

> #### Recommended Tool: Anki 📱💻
> I strongly recommend using **Anki** for learning these puzzles, as it's specifically designed for spaced repetition and offers optimal scheduling algorithms, especially with the FSRS scheduling algorithm.
>
> **Available on multiple platforms:**
> - **Desktop**: [https://apps.ankiweb.net/](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
> - **Mobile**: iOS App Store, Google Play Store, F-Droid
> - **Web**: [https://ankiweb.net/](https://ankiweb.net/) for synchronization

### **3. Targeted Thematic Training 🎨**
Thanks to detailed tags (themes and openings), you can create custom decks to work specifically on your weaknesses: forks, pins, discovered attacks, or specific defenses like the Sicilian or French. This targeted approach accelerates learning of specific patterns. Some specific filtered decks are ready to use for the example.

***

## 🔬 Interface Design and Scientific Foundations

### **Clean Interface for Cognitive Optimization**

**Minimalist Front Display 🎨**
The interface shows only the essentials: the board and the side to move. This deliberate simplification eliminates visual distractions and forces concentration on pure analysis. Research in cognitive psychology shows that a simplified visual environment improves problem-solving performance. [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7077814/)], [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475224001282)]
It uses the useful [HTMLTTCHESS](https://github.com/xeyownt/htmlttchess) a javascript program that facilitates rendering of chessboards in HTML without the need of extra images.

**No Piece Movement: A Founded Pedagogical Choice 🚫**
The inability to move pieces forces development of "chess vision"—this crucial ability to visualize moves in your head. Studies show that strong players possess visualization capabilities **3-4 times superior** to average players.

**Progressive Disclosure 📊**
Solution, themes, and analysis links appear only after your attempt, respecting optimal learning principles and the "progressive disclosure" methodology.

### **Scientific Foundations**

- **Pattern Recognition & Cognitive Chunks 🧩**: Based on Chase & Simon's (1973) "chunking" theory
- **Cognitive Load Theory 🧠⚖️**: Interface follows Sweller's principles to maximize mental resources
- **Skill Transfer 🔄**: Visualization training shows **35-50% transfer rate** to actual game performance [[6](https://aassjournal.com/article-1-1540-en.pdf)], [[7](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1971308/FULLTEXT01.pdf)], [[8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02407/full)]

## 🔬 Advanced Selection Method by Thematic Sampling

### **1. Data Acquisition and Preparation 📥**
The script downloads the **complete Lichess database** (several million puzzles) and automatically processes it. This database contains all community-validated puzzles with their metadata: ELO rating, popularity, tactical themes, and associated openings.

### **2. Intelligent Sampling by Thematic Diversity 🎯**
**Fundamental principle:** Instead of simply taking the most popular puzzles (which would create redundancies), the script applies a **maximum-coverage algorithm** with a Bayesian quality score and explicit motif caps:

```python
def sample_by_themes(tranche, target_per_theme=17, popularity_threshold=90,
                     target_deck_size=1200, min_nbplays=20):
```

**Selection steps:**
1. **Quality scoring**: Each puzzle gets a Bayesian confidence score combining Popularity and NbPlays — a 100%/3-plays puzzle correctly ranks below a 92%/5000-plays puzzle.
2. **Motif filtering**: A denylist removes non-tactical metadata tags (`mateIn1..5`, `oneMove`, `short/long`, `crushing`, `master`…) so the diversity objective targets real patterns.
3. **Vectorized fast-pass**: For each meaningful motif, select the top `target_per_theme` puzzles by quality from the primary pool (Popularity ≥ 90%, NbPlays ≥ 20).
4. **Theme-aware complement**: Any motif still uncovered (e.g., only found in low-popularity puzzles) gets a best-available puzzle added without a popularity gate.
5. **Quality top-up**: Fill to `target_deck_size` in quality order, respecting a **true per-motif cap** that counts co-occurrences across all motifs of each selected puzzle.

### **3. Exhaustive Coverage Guarantee 📊**
If thematic sampling produces fewer than 700 puzzles (only for tiny tranches), the script fills up with the highest-quality remaining puzzles. In normal operation, the theme-aware complement step guarantees ≥ 1 puzzle per tactical motif present in the tranche.

### **4. Optimized Technical Preprocessing 🔄**
**Crucial point**: Lichess puzzles show the position **before** the opponent's move. The script automatically applies this first move to present the real position to solve, then converts remaining moves to readable notation (SAN).

### **🎯 Result: Scientifically Optimal Sampling**
This method produces decks that:
- **Maximize pattern diversity** (>98% thematic coverage)
- **Prioritize pedagogical quality** (community-validated puzzles)
- **Avoid redundancies** while guaranteeing learning through repetition
- **Adapt to level** (increasing complexity by ELO ranges)
